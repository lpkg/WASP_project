\section{Task definition}
Lissy Pellaco, Xuechun Xu, Mina Ferizbegovic will take the task of designing and implementing auto-calibration algorithm of multi-camera system, given the rotation matrix and translation vector of the camera system, estimated from IMU data. They will use simulated data for testing the algorithm.
 
\section{Planning}
\begin{itemize}
\item single-camera scenario - using simulated 3D world points with known coordinates and pinhole camera model;
\item multi-camera scenario - using data and models same as above;
\item self-calibration algorithm -  using simulated 3D world feature points and lines. Exploiting the use of multiple cameras of known position we will remove as much a priori knowledge as possible.
\end{itemize}
